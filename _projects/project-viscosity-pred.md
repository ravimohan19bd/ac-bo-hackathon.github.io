Project 1 description
A combination of vegetable oils with various viscosities are used for preparation of carriers  for colorants and other additives. Achieving the right balance in terms of rheological behavior is critical to achive sufficient shelf life, distribution of addiitves, and also for flowability. 
A Bayesian optimization approach will be expereimented to understand if the right combination can be achieved with fewer iterations.
